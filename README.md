# AI-Based-Traffic-Optimizer

# AI-Based Traffic Management System 🚦
# Overview
This project is an AI-powered traffic management system that dynamically analyzes real-time traffic data to optimize signal timings. By adjusting traffic light phases based on congestion levels, the system improves traffic flow, reduces wait times, and enhances overall road safety.

Features
✅ Real-time traffic data analysis 📊
✅ Dynamic signal timing adjustments ⏳
✅ Congestion detection & optimization 🚗
✅ Reduces wait times & improves traffic flow 🏎️
✅ Supports multi-directional high-traffic routes 🌎

# Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Traffic Simulation: SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
Computer Vision (if used): OpenCV
Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
Deployment: Flask / FastAPI

# Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

(https://github.com/piyush07-bhardwaj)
cd AI-Traffic-Management
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:


python main.py
Optional: To run traffic simulation, install SUMO:


sudo apt-get install sumo  # Linux
brew install sumo          # macOS


# Usage
The system continuously collects real-time traffic data from cameras or sensors.
It analyzes congestion patterns and predicts traffic density.
Based on congestion levels, it adjusts traffic light signals dynamically.
Optimized signal timing improves traffic flow and reduces bottlenecks.


# Future Enhancements
🔹 Integration with IoT sensors & smart city infrastructure
🔹 Predictive analytics for proactive traffic control
🔹 Edge AI processing for faster real-time decisions
🔹 Mobile app integration for user insights
